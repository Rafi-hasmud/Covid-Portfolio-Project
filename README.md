# Covid-Portfolio-Project

The Covid Portfolio Project is a data exploration project designed to interpret and figure out information about Covid-19 patients worldwide. The project uses two datasets, CovidDeaths.xlsx and CovidVaccinations.xlsx, which have been cleaned in Excel and loaded into a Microsoft SQL Server database for data exploration.

## Files
The project includes the following files:

CovidDeaths.xlsx: the dataset containing information on Covid-19 deaths worldwide

CovidVaccinations.xlsx: the dataset containing information on Covid-19 vaccinations worldwide


Data Exploration.sql: the SQL code used to explore the data in the database

## Data Exploration
The Data Exploration.sql file contains SQL queries for exploring the Covid-19 data. The following queries have been used in this project:

Select all data from the CovidDeaths table, ordered by the 3rd and 4th columns.

Select all data from the CovidVaccinations table, ordered by the 3rd and 4th columns.

Select specific columns from the CovidDeaths table, ordered by location and date.

Show the relationship between total cases and total deaths in countries where the location contains the word "states".

Show the percentage of the population that got Covid-19 in countries where the location contains the word "states".

Show the countries with the highest infection rate compared to population.

Show the countries with the highest death count per population.

Break down the data by continent and show the continents with the highest death count per population.

Show global Covid-19 numbers, including total cases, total deaths, and death percentage.

Show the total population vs. vaccination numbers.
